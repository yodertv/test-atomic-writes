test-atomic-writes
==================
Test your filesystem's ability to correctly serialize writes as expected in APPEND mode on a POSIX system.

## Resources
- [Visit Golang!](https://golang.org)
- [Not the Wizard!](https://www.notthewizard.com/2014/06/17/are-files-appends-really-atomic)
- [Stackoverflow file-append atomic question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1154446/is-file-append-atomic-in-unix)

## Usage
```
mikes-air:test-atomic-writes mike$ ./test-atomic-writes -s 1
Between 1 and 222 workers, writing at least 1 each, of at least size 2 required to test.
Usage of ./test-atomic-writes:
  -c int
    	c(ount): of writes per worker, use at least 1 (default 50)
  -f string
    	f(ilename) to use for test (default "out.tmp")
  -readonly
    	readonly: just run the validate function, use identical flags
  -s int
    	s(size): in bytes to write, use at least 2 (default 4096)
  -w int
    	w(orkers): number of concurent writers, use at least 1 and no more than 222 (default 50)
  -worker int
    	worker: perform the writes, internal (default -1)
```
Note: The readonly switch also needs the identical parameters used to create the file.
Note: Shuffle express how interleved the workers output is with one another. It is the ratio of the times a message and its predecessor were written by different workers over the number of workers.

## Test
```
go test -v main_test.go
cd api
go test -v start.go start_test.go
```
## Example deployed on Vercel

- See the test results from the last deployment at https://test-atomic-writes.vercel.app/test-output.log.
- See the build output from the last deployment at https://test-atomic-writes.vercel.app/build-output.log.

## Todo
- Fix api/start to call the test code properly. Currently just demonstrated by extracting go environment info and executing "ls" and "pwd".

## Resolved Issues
- Write in append mode in Mac OS X APFS doesn't appear to be atomic. Resolved 6.9.2018.

## Dev log

### 10.28.2025
- Picking up on being able to trigger the test from the api.

### 8.27.2024
- Redeploying to vercel w/ Github integration.
- Adjusting build.sh.
- Lamda code is running and producing output at https://test-atomic-writes.vercel.app/api/start.

### 8.23.2020
- Able to deploy to Vercel to build and test. Demonstrates a lamba API. Added required build.sh.
- Test both parts by using:
```
go test -v . ./api
```

### 8.15.2020
- Continuing to work on getting this go function running on Vercel. Code compiles and runs locally. Fails to build:
```
2020-08-15T19:49:14.438Z  Error: Could not find an exported function in "api/test-atomic-writes.go"
2020-08-15T19:49:14.438Z  Learn more: https://vercel.com/docs/runtimes#official-runtimes/go
```

### 8.10.2020
- Added a test for the API to force it to compile with out having to deploy.

### 8.8.2020
- Days of wfh and physical isolation: 148
- Zeit deco'd version 1.0. So this is first forray into Vercel. Will attempt to deploy this go cmdline program as a serverless function.
- The idea is to make an API that will exec that cmdline app and direct it's output as the http respons.
- Replaced now with vercel. Go API is working to replace DOCKER setup. This is better because the test can be triggered by querring the API.

### 2.18.2019
- Added deployment details for Zeit Now v1 where the default test ran successfully.

### 6.12.2018
- Tested new beta for 10.13.5:

### 6.9.2018
- Apple asked me to test 10.14, it's not out for public beta so I retested to get ready. Apfs seems to be working on High Sierra 10.13.5.

### 2.13.2018
-  Cleaned up stats. test works, but results seem to suggest that whenever the writes are shuffled between writers, writes are lost.
### 2.10.2018
- writing an append write test program. Modeled after Oz Soloman's shell script for the same purpose. His can be found [here](https://www.notthewizard.com/2014/06/17/are-files-appends-really-atomic/).
